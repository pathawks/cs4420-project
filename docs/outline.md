#### Abstract


#### Introduction


#### Prior Work

*Rui*: Where did you read the heuristic algorithms?

#### Methods

- Generation:
  - Started with goal state, permuted to non-goal states according to number of moves
  - Generated all permutations of n-board states.
  - Enables a ground truth for a board state search
-

#### Results

- 3x3 Board
- 4x4 board


#### Discussion

- Questions:
  * Which heuristic performed the best?
  * How do the heuristic metrics change over the solution complexity?
  * What, if any, trade offs are there within the heuristics?

#### Conclusion
