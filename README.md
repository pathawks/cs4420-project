### How to run
Compile with `make` and run in your shell with `scala Project.jar <file.txt> <search> <heuristic>` where:

  * `<file.txt>` File containing a text representation of the puzzle to solve
    (See `test-board.txt` for an example)
  * `<search>` Search algorithm to use. Can be one of
    - `astar` A*
    - `ida`   Iterative Deepening A*
  * `<heuristic>` Heuristic to use. Can be one of
    - `dummy`  Always returns `0`
    - `manhattan` Sum of Manhattan distance of all tiles to correct position
    - `linearConflict` Linear Conflict
    - `NMaxSwap` Number of swaps between incorrect tiles and empty space
      necessary to arrive at solution
    - `nonAdditiveFringe` Nonadditive Pattern Database
    - `nonAdditiveCorner` Nonadditive Pattern Database
    - `nonAdditiveMax` Maximum of nonAdditiveFringe & nonAdditiveCorner
    - `disjointPDBVertical` Disjoint Pattern Database
    - `disjointPDBHorizontal` Disjoint Pattern Database
    - `disjointPDBMax` Maximum of disjointPDBVertical & disjointPDBHorizontal

The program will return results as a row of Comma Seperated Values in the
format:

```csv
Board Size, <file.txt>, <search>, <heuristic>, Expanded Nodes, Effective Branching Factor, Number of moves in optimal solution, run time
```

All of our data was generated by running `launch.sh` on the data files in
`data/3x3.tgz` and `data/4x4.tgz`. Each of these archives contain all of the
puzzles of that board size that are solvable in 20 or fewer moves. They are
organized into subdirectories by size of the optimal solution.
If these files are expanded, `launch.sh` can be executed to rerun tests, albeit
with perhaps a different subset of test cases.
